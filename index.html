    <p>Hi! My name is Carrie and I am a student in the Stiegler Cohort Program. I am 56-years-old
        and a proud single parent of three adult children, and I have two handsome grandsons. I live in an apartment in Wilmington, NC. 
        I have a Masters in Instructional Technology, a Bachelors in Criminology, and an Associate of Arts and an Associates
         in Medical Office Administration. I have spent most of my life in NC, lived in VA for 10 years as a child, and traveled to 
         other states such as Tennesee, Ohio, and Hawaii, when married to a marine. I love life and try to practice kindness every day!
         
    </p>
